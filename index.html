      <p>According to legend, King Padmanabha Birabara Harichandan was on a hunting expedition when he reached the area near the present-day Taleswari Temple. Inspired by a divine vision from Goddess Hingula, he established his capital there, naming it Talcher after the family deity, Taleswari. The goddess advised the king to worship both her and Goddess Taleswari to defeat the opposing Khandual Zamindar. The king obeyed, emerged victorious, and named the area "Talcher." He is remembered as a pious ruler who constructed many temples in the state.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-2">Deulajhari Hot Spring, located around 25 km from Talcher, is a natural marvel known for its sulfur-rich thermal waters believed to have medicinal and healing properties. Nestled amidst dense forests and ancient trees, the spring lies beside a revered Shiva temple, attracting both spiritual devotees and nature lovers. The warm waters flow continuously and are collected in small bathing enclosures for safe and peaceful use. Deulajhari is especially popular during Maha Shivaratri when pilgrims gather to bathe and offer prayers. The serene environment, surrounded by banyan and peepal trees, makes it a unique blend of wellness, spirituality, and natural beauty — a hidden gem in the Talcher-Angul tourism circuit.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-2">The Jagannath Temple in Talcher, located in Odisha's Angul district, is a significant religious site dedicated to Lord Jagannath, a revered form of Lord Vishnu.  This temple holds historical importance, having been established by Raja Bhagirath Birabar, the ruler of Talcher from 1778 to 1846.  He constructed the temple using massive stones, reflecting the architectural grandeur of the period.  The temple is situated in Talcher Town, with its coordinates being approximately X64Q+2FR, Talcher Town, Odisha 759107, India.  

The temple's architecture and rituals closely mirror those of the famous Jagannath Temple in Puri, emphasizing the deep-rooted cultural and religious connections between the two sites.  This alignment underscores the significance of Talcher's temple in the broader context of Odisha's religious heritage. 

Visitors to Talcher can explore this temple to experience its spiritual ambiance and historical architecture.  It's advisable to check local resources or contact the temple authorities for information on visiting hours and any special events or festivals.

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-2">The Samal Barrage, located on the Brahmani River near Talcher in Odisha’s Angul district, is a crucial part of the Rengali Irrigation Project. It was built to divert water for irrigation across multiple districts, supply industrial water, and support cooling needs for the NTPC Talcher Kaniha power plant. The barrage stretches about 533 meters in length and has significant discharge capacity through its head regulators. While it has greatly enhanced irrigation and industrial development, the project also caused submergence of several villages, leading to displacement and ongoing rehabilitation challenges for affected residents. The area is well connected by roads, with Talcher town about 35 km away, but concerns over soil erosion, siltation, and pollution have impacted water retention and availability. Despite these challenges, the Samal Barrage remains an important infrastructure asset for the region’s economy and agriculture.

The temple is renowned for the Hingula Yatra, an annual festival held during Chaitra Shukla Chaturdashi (around March-April), where Goddess Hingula is believed to manifest in the form of fire.  Devotees gather to offer prayers and sacrifices, and the event concludes with the Sital Puja after nine days  .

This open-air rock relief depicts Lord Vishnu reclining on the cosmic serpent Ananta and is among the largest horizontal rock-cut sculptures of its kind in India, measuring about 15.4 meters (51 feet) in length.  

Carved during the early 9th century CE under the Bhauma-Kara dynasty, the sculpture features Vishnu with four arms, holding a chakra (discus), shankha (conch), gada (mace), and a symbolic lotus.  The image portrays Vishnu in a serene reclining posture, with the serpent Ananta's hoods forming a protective canopy over his head.  A lotus emerging from Vishnu's navel supports the creator god Brahma, who is depicted in meditation.  

The site is situated on the left bank of the Brahmani River, at an elevation of approximately 61 meters (200 feet).  It is accessible by road, approximately 1.5 km from Saranga village.  The sculpture is maintained by the Archaeological Survey of India and continues to be a place of worship for locals.  Due to its location in the riverbed, the sculpture faces potential threats from flooding, but efforts are made to preserve its condition.  

This site offers a unique glimpse into the religious and artistic heritage of medieval Odisha and is a testament to the region's rich cultural history. </p>

      <li>2 units × 110 MW each (Stage II - added in the 1980s)</li>
      <li>2 units × 120 MW each (Stage III - commissioned before NTPC takeover)</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
    <strong>Coal Supply & Logistics:</strong> Coal was primarily sourced from the Bharatpur and Lingaraj mines of Mahanadi Coalfields Ltd (MCL), located nearby in Talcher. The proximity to coal mines reduced transportation costs and made the plant economically viable. The coal was transported via dedicated rail sidings directly into the plant's bunkers.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
    <strong>Water Supply:</strong> The Brahmani River, through the Samal Barrage, was the main source of water. Water was used for boiler feed, cooling systems, and ash handling processes. Efficient recycling and ash water recovery systems were in place to conserve water.

  </div>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
    <strong>Overview:</strong> The Talcher Fertilizer Plant is a major upcoming urea production facility located in Talcher, Angul district, Odisha. Originally operated as the Talcher Unit of the Fertilizer Corporation of India (FCI), it was shut down in the early 2000s. The plant is now being revived as part of the Government of India's initiative to boost domestic urea production and reduce import dependency.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
    <strong>Project Revival:</strong> The revival of the Talcher plant is being carried out by **Talcher Fertilizers Limited (TFL)** — a joint venture of five public sector companies: GAIL (India) Ltd., RCF (Rashtriya Chemicals and Fertilizers), CIL (Coal India Ltd.), FCIL (Fertilizer Corporation of India), and HTAS Consortium. TFL aims to use coal gasification technology to produce urea from indigenous coal, making it a first-of-its-kind plant in India.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
    <strong>Technology:</strong> Unlike conventional fertilizer plants that use natural gas, the Talcher Fertilizer Plant will use a **coal gasification process** to convert coal into synthesis gas (syngas), which will then be used to produce ammonia and urea. The plant is expected to use around 2.5 million tonnes of coal annually.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
    <strong>Capacity:</strong> The revived facility will have a production capacity of approximately <strong>1.27 million metric tonnes of urea per annum</strong>. This will significantly contribute to India's urea production and enhance agricultural productivity.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
    <strong>Employment and Economic Impact:</strong> The project is expected to generate substantial direct and indirect employment for the region. It will also boost the local economy through infrastructure development, transportation demand, and support industries.
